Make moving freaks pure black, baked lighting doesnt work on them so just make em evil
do something about the zfighting if possible
see if anything can be done about the light leaking
fix whatever flash happens when the credits start
fix freak placement
freak speed seems dependent on framerate, fix that

garbage noise when walking in the big piles (maybe slowdown too?)
movement below you while in south west room
do something to make the ladder more visible (fake light baking on all windows?)
creak on first F2 spot
have freaks peek in when you are half way through falling into the basement
better sounds on the freaks
