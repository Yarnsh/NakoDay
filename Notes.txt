fix freaks getting stuck in walls (probably bad map normals, man...)

scary red light turns on where the freaks wake up to scare you towards the proper path
garbage noise when walking in the big piles (maybe slowdown too?)
movement below you while in south west room
creak on first F2 spot
have freaks peek in when you are half way through falling into the basement
