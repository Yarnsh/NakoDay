# NakoDay
Nako's birthday present

### pre-planning ideas
- Nako with a camera in a spooky place
  - Camera flash used to see where youre going in dark places
  - Save the pictures to actual files for fun
- Make horns visible at the top of the screen in first person
- Guy peeking at you from a doorway, as you approach it falls and it was just a manequin in a closet that fell out
- other generic spooky nonsense
- Real thing chases/pushes you through a scarzy path to a room that has the surprise party in it
- the present is a gun and you can go back through and shoot the monster
